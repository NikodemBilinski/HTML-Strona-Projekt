            June 11 2018 was the date that new The Elder Scrolls 6 was annoucned by our beloved Todd Howard.
            <br><br>
            I guess we are waiting for another release of Skyrim on every known to man console that will break 90% of the mods on nexus mod manager,<br>
            can't wait for that to happen.
            <br><br>
            Maybe we will be able to play it in the same time that GTA 8 or Clair Obscur Expedition 34 comes out.
            <br><br>
            Below is a timer showing how much time has passed since the first announcment.
